# Spotify Playlist Challenge

This repository is used for a Machine Learning course project, and simultaneously is a part of the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge.

In the [first notebook](https://github.com/admirkrilasevic/spotify-playlist-challenge/blob/main/Spotify%20Playlist%20Data%20Preprocessing%20-%20Challenge%20Set.ipynb) data from the [challenge set](https://github.com/admirkrilasevic/spotify-playlist-challenge/blob/main/challenge_set.json) is analyzed and preprocessed for clustering.

In the [second notebook](https://github.com/admirkrilasevic/spotify-playlist-challenge/blob/main/Spotify%20Playlist%20Clustering%20-%20Challenge%20Set.ipynb) two clustering algorithms (KMeans and DBSCAN) are applied to the [processed data](https://github.com/admirkrilasevic/spotify-playlist-challenge/blob/main/playlists-challenge.json).

In the [third notebook](https://github.com/admirkrilasevic/spotify-playlist-challenge/blob/main/Spotify%20Playlist%20Clustering%20-%20Application.ipynb) the better of the two algorithms is applied to a personal Spotify account to see its application.
